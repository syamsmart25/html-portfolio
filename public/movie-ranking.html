<hr/>
<h3>The Passion of the Christ (2004)</h3>
<p>- Mel Gibson's intense and controversial film focuses specifically on the final 12 hours of Jesus's life, depicting his crucifixion with graphic realism that sparked both praise and criticism for its visceral portrayal of Christ's suffering.</p>
<h3>Jesus of Nazareth (1977) </h3>
<p>- Franco Zeffirelli's made-for-TV miniseries is widely considered one of the most comprehensive and respectful adaptations of Jesus's life, featuring an all-star cast and covering his story from birth to resurrection across six hours.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)</h3>
<p> - This epic Hollywood production was notable for its massive scale and star-studded cast, though it's often remembered more for its ambitious scope and lengthy runtime than for connecting emotionally with audiences.</p>
<h3>The Last Supper (2025)</h3>
<p>- The Last Supper was given by Jesus, to the Church, as a symbolic reminder of His saving work for us, through His death on the cross. The Last Supper is symbolic. It is a channel through which we are reminded of the saving grace we have received.</p>
