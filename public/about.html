<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Syam, a 23-year-old with a spark for life and a knack for diving deep into my passions. I’m the kind of person who’s always chasing curiosity, whether it’s through lines of code, the lens of a camera, or just a random adventure that catches my eye. I like to think of myself as a blend of tech geek and creative dreamer, always tinkering with ideas and capturing moments that tell a story.</p>

<p>Coding and programming are my playground. I love building things from scratch—whether it’s a sleek web app, a quirky game, or even a script to automate some mundane task that’s been bugging me. Python and JavaScript are my go-to languages, but I’m always messing around with new frameworks or dabbling in Rust for the thrill of it. There’s something magical about turning a blank screen into something functional, like solving a puzzle that didn’t exist until you imagined it. Right now, I’m working on a side project—a photo-sharing app with a twist: it uses AI to suggest edits based on the mood of the image. It’s still a work in progress, but I’m stoked about where it’s headed.</p>

<p>Photography, though, is where I let my soul wander. I’m not one of those gear-obsessed shutterbugs; for me, it’s about capturing raw, unfiltered moments. My favorite shots are candid street photos—think bustling markets at dusk or an old man feeding pigeons in the rain. I shoot with a beat-up Nikon DSLR I got secondhand, and I’m obsessed with chasing golden-hour light. I’ve got this ritual where I’ll wander a new part of town with just my camera and no plan, letting the world surprise me. Some of my best shots are on my X profile—check out @SyamSnaps if you’re curious!</p>

<p>Beyond that, I’m a bit of a night owl who thrives on late-night coding sessions with lo-fi beats in the background. I’m also a sucker for sci-fi novels—Dune is my all-time favorite—and I’ll nerd out over a good coffee shop with a vibe. I’m always up for a chat about tech, art, or just the weird little things that make life interesting. My friends say I’m the guy who’ll show up with a wild idea, like “let’s build a drone to take aerial shots at sunrise,” and somehow make it happen.</p>
